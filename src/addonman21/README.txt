Support: https://github.com/lovac42/AddonManager21

These files are backported from anki-2.1.5 src with a few mods here and there.

This addon must be loaded first, so the first file is named 1.py in the main directory. The newer editions may not require this, but if you run into any problems, rename addonman21_addon.py to 1.py and see if that fixes things.


Each addon must have it's own folder with a config.json file.
